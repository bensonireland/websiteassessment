    I used these common Techniques and Features in blender when making my model.

            <p>Blender has many techniques and features you can use for your design. The main techniques I used were moving, rotating, scaling, and extruding. This helped me to make my object the right size and shape.<br><br>Edit mode was an important feature, that allowed me to apply the previous techniques to each vertice, line, and face of the object. This is what allowed me to shape each detail of my model correctly.
                <br>
                <br>Using material nodes allowed my to create the surface of my model. I used them to get the roughness I wanted, as well as the colours of the object. I made a practice model to practice these technques and features, as well as to test out the rendering.</p>
